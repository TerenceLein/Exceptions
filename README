  EXCEPTIONS.PHP
  Setup handlers for unprocessed errors and exceptions.
  
  Information about any unexpected or unhandled error will be formatted and 
  bundled with a dump of session variables (GET, POST, FILES, SESSION, SERVER). This
  is inluded in an email that is sent to the server administrator. Unattended servers will 
  find this useful. Alternatively, if the session variable Debug="Yes", the information will 
  be echoed back to the screen instead of the email.
  
  Handlers
  OnError, OnException
  
  Globals
  $page    page to return to user after reporting error. The created error
           will be in session variable "Fatal_Error".
